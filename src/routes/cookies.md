## General statement on Cookies

The Website uses cookies and/or other similar technologies to collect and store certain information. This typically involves pieces of information or code transferred to or accessed from your computer hard drive or mobile device to store and sometimes track information about you, and to distinguish you from other users of the Website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse (e.g. storing searches and presenting personalised content) and also allows us to improve the Website. This document should be read in conjunction with [Gitpod's Privacy Policy](/privacy).

A number of cookies and similar technologies last only for the duration of your web or app session and expire when you close your browser or exit the Website. Others are used to remembering you when you return to the Website and will last for longer.

We use strictly necessary cookies if they are necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights). We use all other cookies with your consent.

We use the following types of cookies, the specific details of which are set out in the table further below:

## Strictly necessary cookies

These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Site and under our terms with you. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or (on other sites) use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.

## Functionality cookies

These may be used to recognise you when you return to our Site. This enables us, subject to your choices and preferences, to personalise our content, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, choice of language or region).

## Analytical / Performance cookies

These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Stie when they are using it. This helps us improve the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

Targeting/Advertising cookies

These cookies record your visit to our Website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information subject to your choices and preferences to make our Website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.
