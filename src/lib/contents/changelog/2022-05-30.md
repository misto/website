### New License tab in the admin panel

You can now see details about the license used by your installation, how many seats it has left, and the features your license includes. You can navigate to this page by going to the admin dashboard (top right corner of the Gitpod dashboard, which requires you to be an admin user) and selecting `License` in the navigation menu.
