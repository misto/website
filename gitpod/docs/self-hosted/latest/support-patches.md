# Gitpod Provided Support Patches

Further customisation of your installation is possible within the installation UI, where Gitpod can provide you with a support patch to tailor the installation. In the “Additional Options” section, click the “Enable additional options” checkbox, and upload the file in the “Gitpod config patch” field.

The patch file is effectively a patch for the internally used [Gitpod Installer config file](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/blob/main/install/installer/example-config.yaml). All values that are set in the patch file will override the generated config file values.
