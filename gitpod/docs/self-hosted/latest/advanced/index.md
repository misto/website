# Advanced Installation of Gitpod Self-Hosted

Here you can find advanced topics related to installing Gitpod:

- [TLS configuration for Gitpod Self-Hosted](./advanced/tls)
- [Install Gitpod on an Air Gappped Network](./advanced/air-gap)
- [Applying custom annotations, labels and environment variables](./advanced/customization)
- [Manual installation of Gitpod using the Gitpod Installer](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/tree/main/install/installer) (not recommended - we strongly recommend the default installation method in the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started))
<!-- The above should be removed as soon as we have most customers using the default method (a.k.a. replicated flow) -->
