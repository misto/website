In line with [our ambition to "remove all friction from the developer experience"](https://www.notion.so/gitpod/Values-Attributes-2ed4c2f93c84499b98e3b5389980992e), Gitpod currently supports many popular IDE/editors e.g. JetBrains and VS Code through both the browser and on desktop. You can even use the command-line directly for editors like Vim (via SSH). There are many ways to [configure your IDE/editor in Gitpod](ides-and-editors/configure-your-editor-ide) to match your preferred workflow or setup.

## Connecting an IDE/editor to Gitpod

The three main ways to edit code or access a Gitpod workspace:

1. **Browser** - Using [VS Code Browser](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser).
2. **SSH** - Using an [SSH key](/docs/ides-and-editors/command-line#ssh-key-access) or an [Access Token](/docs/ides-and-editors/command-line#access-token-ssh).
3. **Desktop** - Using [VS Code Desktop](ides-and-editors/vscode) or [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/ides-and-editors/jetbrains-gateway).
