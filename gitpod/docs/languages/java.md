# Java in Gitpod

Gitpod comes with great support for Java. This guide walks you through how to fully configure a Java application using Gitpod.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with:

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) and Linux [environment variables](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/environment_variables).

## Getting Started / Quick Start

`youtube: w65POyu3ZUQ`

To see a full working Java application, take a look at [gitpod-io/spring-petclinic](https://github.com/gitpod-io/spring-petclinic/). To update an existing Java application, follow the steps below in this guide.

</a>

## Installing dependencies

### The default base image

The default Gitpod workspace image default is [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) based on [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).

Along with other languages and tools, this base image includes:

- [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) `v5.15.0` (`sdk version`)
- [Java](https://www.java.com) `v11.0.13` (`java -version`)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) `v7.4.1` (`gradle -version`)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) `v3.8.5` (`mvn -version`)

> **Note:** We discuss how to set up a [custom base image](/docs/languages/java#setting-up-a-custom-dockerfile) later in the guide.

### Updating Java, Maven & Gradle

For alternative versions to those provided in the Gitpod base image, with [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/usage#listversions) you can quickly update your dependencies: `sdk install <candidate> [version]`

> **Important:** Dynamically swapping Java, Maven or Gradle versions manually is a quick way to explore Gitpod. However, for day-to-day development **strongly recommend to add explicit dependency versions in your gitpod.yml or Dockerfile**.

#### Updating Java version

- `sdk list java` - to see available java versions
- `sdk install java 18.0.1.fx-zulu` - to install a specific version

#### Updating Maven version

- `sdk list maven` - to see available maven versions
- `sdk install maven 3.8.6` - to install a specific version

#### Updating Gradle version

- `sdk list gradle` - to see available gradle versions
- `sdk install gradle 7.4.1` - to install a specific version

### Setting up a custom Dockerfile

`youtube: jFsbmcXCRf8`

To ensure Gitpod workspaces always start with the correct dependencies, configure a Dockerfile:

1. Create a `.gitpod.yml`

```bash
touch .gitpod.yml
```

2. Create a custom Dockerfile

```bash
touch .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

3. Reference your newly created Dockerfile in your `.gitpod.yml`

```yaml
image:
  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

4. Update your `.gitpod.Dockerfile` to install your dependency versions

```Dockerfile
FROM gitpod/workspace-full

USER gitpod

RUN bash -c ". /home/gitpod/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh && \
    sdk install java 17.0.3-ms && \
    sdk default java 17.0.3-ms"
```

5. Commit and push both `gitpod.yml` and `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

```bash
git commit -m "configuring gitpod with java" && git push
```

6. Start a **new workspace** from the branch with the committed `.gitpod.Dockerfile`

For example, opening: `gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod`

7. Test your dependencies are correct in the new workspace

```bash
sdk current
```

> **Note:** If your changes are not taking effect, ensure your workspace is building from the correct [context](/docs/context-urls), where your `gitpod.yml` or `gitpod.Dockerfile` are checked in to version control and are on the branch or commit that you are opening.

See [configure Docker](/docs/config-docker) for more.

## Build and run your application

### Building a Java application

To build your application, you'll need to configure a [start task](/docs/config-start-tasks).

Start tasks are processes that are initiated on every workspace start. Depending on your project setup, start tasks can be used to build your application, run your application directly, or start any necessary tools for the application to run, such as starting database processes.

1. Add the command to build your application to your `.gitpod.yml`

**Example with Gradle**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: gradle build
```

**Example with Maven**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: mvn package
```

2. **Optional:** Validate by stopping and starting (restart) your workspace

```bash
gp stop
```

3. **Optional:** Validate your commands by running [`gp tasks`](/docs/command-line-interface#tasks)

```shell
gp tasks
```

> **Tip:** If you're using [VS Code Browser](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser) or [VS Code Desktop](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode), then your tasks will open as terminal windows. You can configure their layout using the [openMode](/docs/config-start-tasks#openmode) property.

> **Note:** We are using the `init` property so that we can perform application building during a [prebuild](/docs/prebuilds), for increased performance. We'll discuss prebuilds more later on.

See [start tasks](/docs/config-start-tasks) and [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

### Running a Java application

To run your application, you have two options:

1. **Update your start task command** - Starting your application using the `command` start task will run the start process on workspace start. With both [VS Code Browser](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode) and [VS Code Desktop](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser), tasks are automatically opened in the terminal(s). With [IntelliJ](/docs/ides-and-editors/intellij) / [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/ides-and-editors/jetbrains-gateway), configured tasks can be viewed by running `gp tasks` in the workspace.
2. **Use a run / launch configuration** - Alternatively, you can commit a [run/debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA](/docs/languages/java#configuring-jetbrains-rundebug-configurations) or a [launch configuration in VS Code](/docs/languages/java#configuring-vs-code-launch-configurations) as a way to start your application.

#### Using start tasks to run Java

1. Add a `command` for starting your application to your `.gitpod.yml`

**Example with Gradle**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: gradle build
    command: gradle run
```

**Example with Maven**

```yaml
tasks:
  - init: mvn package
    command: mvn exec:java
```

1. **Optional:** Validate by stopping and starting (restart) your workspace

```bash
gp stop
```

3. **Optional:** Validate your commands by running [`gp tasks`](/docs/command-line-interface#tasks)

```shell
gp tasks
```

### Configuring environment variables

`youtube: dehln1E8ylY`

Gitpod supports encrypted, user-specific environment variables.

Environment variables are stored as part of your user settings and can be used to set access tokens, or pass any other kind of user-specific information to your workspaces. You can set environment variables using `gp env`, or in your project and account settings.

See [environment variables](/docs/environment-variables) for more.

### Configuring ports

When your project starts a service that listens on a given port, Gitpod automatically serves traffic to this port of your application on an authenticated URL.

If you want to configure ports, such as: their visibility, what Gitpod does when it detects a new port being available, etc, you can do that in the ports section of the .gitpod.yml configuration file.

For example, add the following to your `.gitpod.yml` to configure port `3000` to open in your browser on workspace start.

```yaml
ports:
  - port: 3000
    onOpen: open-browser
```

See [configuring ports](/docs/config-ports) for more

### Configuring localhost

Your development application might rely on the `localhost` hostname to effectively run.

To ensure your localhost address works with Gitpod, you have two options:

1. **Replace localhost references** - Swap `localhost` references within the application with the output of `gp url <port>`, typically via an [environment variable](/docs/environment-variables).

**Example:** Using the `DEV_ENVIRONMENT_HOST` environment variable instead of localhost within the application, configured in the `command` of the `.gitpod.yml` start tasks.

```yaml
tasks:
  - command: |
    export DEV_ENVIRONMENT_HOST=`gp url 3000`
    java <application-entry>
```

2. **Setup localhost port forwarding** - Connect your local machine with your running workspace means that you don't need to replace localhost references, to do that you'll need to configure port forwarding. Port forwarding is useful if you're working with a framework that needs localhost, and the application cannot be reconfigured.

With [VS Code Desktop](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode), local port-forwarding is handled automatically and can be configured via the ports view within VS Code Desktop.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Port forwarding in VS Code Desktop" src="/images/editors/port-forwarding-vscode-desktop.png">
    <figcaption>Port forwarding in VS Code Desktop</figcaption>
</figure>

With IntelliJ IDEA using [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/ides-and-editors/jetbrains-gateway) you can setup remote port-forwarding manually.

<figure>
<img class="shadow-medium w-full rounded-xl max-w-3xl mt-x-small" alt="Port forwarding in a JetBrains IDE" src="/images/jetbrains-gateway/port-forward-jetbrains.png">
    <figcaption>Port forwarding in a JetBrains IDE</figcaption>
</figure>

Alternatively, by using [local companion](/docs/ides-and-editors/local-companion) all workspace ports will be forwarded automatically.

See [configuring ports](/docs/config-ports) for more.

### Configuring VS Code Extensions

To set default plugins to be installed for all users starting a workspace for the project, add a list of the JetBrains plugin identifiers to your `.gitpod.yml` under `vscode.extensions`.

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - vscjava.vscode-java-pack
```

See [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

### Configuring VS Code Launch configurations

Launch configurations can be shared by committing the `.vscode/launch.json` file to version control. To use a launch configuration with Java, need Java version 11 or above, and some VS Code extensions. Assuming you have configured your base image with a compatible JDK version as described above, a simple way to get set up is by adding the Extension Pack for Java will configure the correct VS Code extensions. Alternatively, you can selectively choose the extensions to install.

```yaml
vscode:
  extensions:
    - vscjava.vscode-java-pack
```

See [Debugging in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) and [VS Code Java Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/extensions) for more.

### Configuring JetBrains Run/Debug configurations

To share your run/debug configurations, you can commit their definitions to source control. Since the `.idea` folder contains lots of information used for IntelliJ (which can include sensitive information or secrets) you may wish to ignore the `.idea` from version control, and explicitly allow `.idea/runConfigurations`.

Add run/debug configurations to git, by adding the following to your `.gitignore`.

```
/.idea/*
!/.idea/runConfigurations
```

See [JetBrains Run/Debug configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) documentation for more.

### Configuring JetBrains Plugins

To set default extensions to be installed for all users starting a workspace for the project, add a list of the VS Code extension identifiers to your `.gitpod.yml`.

```yaml
jetbrains:
  intellij:
    plugins:
      - com.intellij.lang.jsgraphql
```

See [.gitpod.yml reference](/docs/references/gitpod-yml) for more.

## Optimising Java Applications

Gitpod prebuilds reduce wait time by installing dependencies or running builds before you start a new workspace. By default, Gitpod prepares prebuilt workspaces for all changes on the default branch and pull/merge requests coming from the same repository. However, prebuilds save only the `workspace` directory, any files stored outside of the workspace directory will be lost. For Java applications, we recommend to execute build commands within an `init` startup task.

`youtube: ZtlJ0PakUHQ`

See [prebuilds](/docs/prebuilds) and [start tasks](/docs/config-start-tasks) for more.

### Optimising JetBrains indexing

> JetBrains prebuilds support (via gitpod.yml) is currently in [Alpha](/docs/references/gitpod-releases) · [Send feedback](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/6576).

Gitpod currently has early support for improved indexing performance with JetBrains IDEs that works out-of-the-box. You can enable this setting via the `.gitpod.yml`.

**Example:** Index both the stable and latest of the IntelliJ IDE

```yaml
jetbrains:
  intellij:
    prebuilds:
      version: stable
```

### Caching Maven dependencies

The default cache location for Maven is the `.m2` directory. However, since this location is by default outside of the `/workspace` directory caches will not be stored as part of a prebuild.

If you are using the [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) image, Maven caching configuration is already enabled.

To configure Maven caching, add the following to your custom [Dockerfile](/docs/config-docker).

1. Create an `.m2` directory in the users (`gitpod`) home directory.

```bash
mkdir /home/gitpod/.m2
```

2. Create a `settings.xml` and configure `localRepository` within `workspace`.

```bash
printf '<settings>\n  <localRepository>/workspace/m2-repository/</localRepository>\n</settings>\n' > /home/gitpod/.m2/settings.xml
```

See [prebuilds](/docs/prebuilds) for more.

### Caching Gradle dependencies

The default location of the gradle home is `$USER_HOME/.gradle`, however, since this location is by default outside of the `/workspace` directory caches will not be stored as part of a prebuild.

If you are using the [workspace-full](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) image, Gradle caching configuration is already enabled.

To configure Gradle caching, add the following to your custom [Dockerfile](/docs/config-docker).

```
ENV GRADLE_USER_HOME=/workspace/.gradle/
```

See [prebuilds](/docs/prebuilds) for more.

## Personalizing Gitpod

All settings introduced so far, such as `.gitpod.yml` and `Dockerfile` apply for all users using of the gitpod project. To apply personalisation, consider setting up [dotfiles](/docs/config-dotfiles), the Gitpod [Browser Extension](/docs/browser-extension),

### Dotfiles

Dotfiles allow you to setup per-user configurations in your Gitpod workspace, such as modifying your shell and adding command aliases. To configure Gitpod to use your own dotfiles for all your workspaces, enter the URL of a public dotfiles repository in your Gitpod [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

See [dotfiles](/docs/config-dotfiles) for more.

### Browser Extension

![Browser Extension](../../../static/images/docs/browser-extension-lense.png)

To make opening Gitpod workspaces easier, install the Gitpod browser extension, which enables an "Open in Gitpod" button on GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

See [Browser Extension](/docs/browser-extension) for more.

### Configure your IDE or editor

    <figcaption>Updating Gitpod IDE preferences to a JetBrains IDE</figcaption>
</figure>

With Gitpod, you can work with [VS Code Browser](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser), [VS Code Desktop](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode) or [JetBrains](/docs/ides-and-editors/jetbrains-gateway) IDEs, such as [IntelliJ IDEA](/docs/ides-and-editors/intellij). Setting your preference ensures all future workspaces start with the chosen IDE or editor. Visit the [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) page to configure these settings.

See [IDEs & Editors](/docs/ides-and-editors) for more.

### VS Code Desktop Settings Sync

    <figcaption>Enable Settings Sync with Gitpod</figcaption>
</figure>

VS Code Desktop by default is not setup to sync your VS Code settings (e.g. your fonts, layouts, etc) with VS Code running in the browser of Gitpod. You can configure Gitpod to sync settings between browser and desktop by running the command palette action "Settings Sync: Enable signing in with Gitpod" from the Gitpod VS Code extension.

See [VS Code Settings Sync](/docs/ides-and-editors/settings-sync) for more.
